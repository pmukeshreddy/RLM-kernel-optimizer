## Optimization Task: FP4 Quantization Lookup Table

Hardware: NVIDIA B200 (sm_100a)
{metrics_str}
Full kernel source (complete .cu file):
```cuda
{kernel_slice}
```

Replace the arithmetic FP4 quantization with a precomputed lookup table:

Background:
NVFP4 has only 16 possible output values (4 bits). The current quantize_block_nvfp4()
does per-element: find absmax → compute scale → clamp → round → bit-pack. This is
expensive arithmetic for a function with only 16 possible outputs.

Requirements:
1. Precompute a __constant__ or __device__ lookup table that maps scaled float values
   to their nearest FP4 encoding (4-bit code)
2. The quantization per block becomes:
   a. Find absmax of the 16-element block (keep this)
   b. Compute E4M3 scale from absmax (keep this)
   c. For each element: multiply by (1/scale), clamp to FP4 range,
      use a LUT indexed by the quantized bin to get the 4-bit code
3. Pack two 4-bit codes per byte as before
4. The LUT approach eliminates the per-element float-to-fp4 conversion arithmetic
5. Ensure the LUT covers both positive and negative values (sign bit handled separately)
6. Keep the E4M3 scale computation identical to the original

Hint: FP4 positive values are [0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6]. You can build a
boundary table [0.25, 0.75, 1.25, 1.75, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0] and use binary search or
linear scan to find the nearest bin. With only 7 boundaries, a linear scan in
registers is faster than any branching approach.

## Optimization Task: Fast Math Intrinsics for SiLU

Hardware: NVIDIA B200 (sm_100a, SFU unit available)
{metrics_str}
Full kernel source (complete .cu file):
```cuda
{kernel_slice}
```

Replace slow math library calls with hardware SFU intrinsics:

Background:
SiLU(x) = x / (1 + exp(-x)). The `expf()` call compiles to a multi-instruction
software routine (~20 cycles). The hardware SFU can compute `__expf()` in ~4 cycles
with slightly reduced precision. Since the output goes to FP4 (only 16 possible
values), the precision difference is completely invisible.

Requirements:
1. Replace `expf(-g)` with `__expf(-g)` in the SiLU computation
2. Replace `1.0f / (1.0f + ...)` with `__frcp_rn(1.0f + ...)` (hardware reciprocal)
3. The optimized SiLU becomes: `x * __frcp_rn(1.0f + __expf(-x))`
4. If rsqrtf is used anywhere, replace with `__frsqrt_rn()`
5. Do NOT change any other logic — only math intrinsic substitutions
6. Preserve all function signatures and launch wrappers

## Optimization Task: Thread Coarsening

Hardware: NVIDIA B200 ({sm_count} SMs, 2048 threads/SM max)
{metrics_str}
Full kernel source (complete .cu file):
```cuda
{kernel_slice}
```

Increase the amount of work each thread performs:

Background:
Currently each thread processes very little data (e.g., 1 quantization block = 16
elements, or a small slice of a row). Thread scheduling, register allocation, and
warp launch overhead dominate. By having each thread process 4-8x more data, we
amortize this overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.

Requirements:
1. Identify the per-thread work unit (quantization block, row elements, etc.)
2. Increase it by 4x:
   - For quantize kernels: each thread processes 4 quant blocks (64 elements)
   - For add_rmsnorm: each block processes 2-4 rows instead of 1
   - Use a grid-stride loop if the total work exceeds grid capacity
3. Adjust grid dimensions: divide grid size by the coarsening factor
4. Use `#pragma unroll` on the coarsened inner loop
5. Keep register usage under 96 per thread to maintain occupancy
6. Handle the tail case: when total work isn't divisible by coarsening factor,
   add a bounds check for the last iterations

{metrics_str}
Full kernel source (complete .cu file):
```cuda

```

Route read-only memory accesses through the L1 texture cache:

Background:
The GPU has a separate read-only data cache (texture/L1 cache) that doesn't
participate in coherence traffic. For data that is only read (never written),
using __ldg() routes loads through this cache, freeing up the normal L1 for
read-write data. Combined with __restrict__, the compiler can also reorder
loads more aggressively.

Requirements:
1. Identify all input pointers that are read-only (never written to):
   - input, residual, weight/rms_weight, gate, up — these are all read-only
2. Mark them with `const __restrict__` if not already done
3. Replace direct reads like `input[idx]` with `__ldg(&input[idx])`
4. For bf16: `__ldg()` works with `__nv_bfloat16` directly
5. Do NOT apply __ldg to output pointers (quant_out, residual_out, scales)
6. Do NOT change any computation logic — only memory access routing

## Optimization Task: Vectorized Stores for Packed Output

{metrics_str}
Full kernel source (complete .cu file):
```cuda

Replace byte-by-byte stores of packed FP4 output with vectorized writes:

Background:
The packed FP4 output is stored byte-by-byte in a loop:
  for (j = 0; j < 8; ++j) quant_out[base + j] = packed_out[j];
Each 1-byte store is a separate memory transaction. A single uint2 store (8 bytes)
replaces all 8 stores with one 64-bit write. Similarly, scale stores can be batched.

Requirements:
1. Accumulate the 8 packed bytes into a uint2 (or two uint32_t values)
2. Store with a single `*reinterpret_cast<uint2*>(&quant_out[base]) = packed_val;`
3. Ensure the output pointer is 8-byte aligned (it should be, since quant blocks
   are 8 bytes each and base addresses are cudaMalloc'd)
4. Also vectorize loads where possible (input bf16 → load as uint4 for 8 bf16 values)
5. Preserve all output semantics — packed byte order must be identical
6. Keep the scale store as-is (single byte, not worth vectorizing alone)
